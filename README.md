# Data Structures and Algorithms Study

## Description
A library implementing various data structures and algorithms in C. I'm using 
this project as a way to deepen my understanding of C, CMake, git, and DSA. An
exhaustive list of all implemented data structures and algorithms can be found [here](#Implemented-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms).

## Dependencies
- CMake

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the project to a directory with `git clone`.
2. `cd` into that directory and create a directory in which to build the project.
3. Run `cmake -B [build] -S .` and replace `[build]` with the directory you just created.
4. Run `cmake --build [build]` and replace `[build]` with the same directory as before.

## Technologies Used
